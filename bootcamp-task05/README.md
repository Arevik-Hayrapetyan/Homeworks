# DESCRIPTION
## ParseFloat exercise explanation
- Writing logic that implements parseInt (in parseFloat.js file). Writing code with this steps.
1. In first step we are declaring input variable (the input variable is user's input)
2. Declaring parse variable for adding them value.
3. In "if loop" we are checking 2 condition:  when our input[0] is not a number and is not equal "." ==> when there are this 2 condition the output is "NaN".
4. In other case creating "for loop" for checking each input[i], if it is number or "." then adding it to "parse" variable until the input[i] is not a letter.
 
## ParseInt exercise explanation
- Writing logic that implements parseInt (in parseInt.js file). Writing code with this steps.
1. In first step we are declaring input variable (the input variable is user's input)
2. Declaring parse variable for adding them value.
3. In "if loop" we are checking if input[0] is not a number then print "NaN"
4. Otherwise in "else loop" we are checking if is not a number break, if it is number in "parse" variable adding input[i].
