words of the array. The last word should not contain the last . or! .
18. Given an array of a size smallerthan 100. It consists of numbers from 0 to 99 in any order. Create a new
array where each element from that array is placed underthe index of its value. Start from the smallest
value and end with the biggest one. If there are missing values, put in its places undefined.
19. Given an array consisting from the arrays of numbers (like a two-dimensional array). Find sum of each
row and print them as an array.
