# Description
- Solving following tasks:
1. Write a recursive function to determine whether all digits of the number are odd or not.
2. Given an array of numbers. Write a recursive function to find its minimal positive
element. (if such element does not exist, return -1).
3. Given an array of numbers which is almost sorted in ascending order. Find the index
where sorting order is violated.
4. Given an array. Write a recursive function that removes the first element and returns the
given array. (without using arr.shift())
5. Given an array of nested arrays. Write a recursive function that flattens it. (Hint create
function that concats arrays).
6. Given an array and a number N. Write a recursive function that rotates an array N
places to the left. (Hint: to add element to the beginning use arr.unshift())
7. Given a number. Write a function that calculates its sum of the digits and if that sum has
more than 1 digit find the sum of digits of that number. Repeat that process if needed
and return the result.
8. Write a recursive function
- to find the sum of a given array.
- to find the factorial of a given natural N.
