# DESCRIPTION
# Function tasks
- In bootcamp-task06 folder I am doing this tasks:
1. Given an array of numbers. Write a function to separate odd and even numbers in different arrays.
2. Write a function that calculates sum, difference, multiplication and division between given array elements
depending on passed operation symbol. Write appropriate function for each operation.
3. Given a phone number. Write a function to clean it up, so it is valid. The rules are as follows:

--If the phone numberis less than 10 digits assume that it is a bad number

--If the phone numberis longerthan 10, then it is a bad number

--If the phone numberis 10 digits assume that it is good
--If the phone number consists of 11 symbols and the first one is + and others are numbers, then trim +
and return remaining 10 digits.

--If the phone number contains + symbol more than one, considerit as a bad number.

--If the phone number contains + symbol not as the first character, considerit as a badnumber.

4. Given a word and a list of possible anagrams, select the correct sublist.
5. Write a function, which receives a string, finds possible largest numbers in the string and returns their
sum.
6. Write a function which receives two strings and removes appearances of the second string from the first
one.
7. Write a function to compute a new string from the given one by moving the first charto come afterthe
next two chars, so "abc" yields "bca". Repeat this process for each subsequent group of 3 chars. Ignore
any group of fewerthan 3 chars at the end.
8. Write a function that accepts a string(a sentence) as a parameter and finds the longest word within the
string. If there are several words which are the longest ones, print the last word(words can be separated
by space, comma or hyphen).
9. Write a function which receives an array and a number as arguments and returns a new array from the
elements of the given array which are largerthan the given number.
10. Write a function to find longest substring in a given a string withoutrepeating characters except space
character. If there are several,return the last one. Considerthat all letters are lowercase.
11. Write a function, which receives two numbers as arguments and finds all numbers between them such
that each digit of the numberis even. The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated
sequence on a single line.
12. Write a function, which receives an array as an argument which elements arrays of numbers. Find
product of biggest negative number of each array. If there is not any negative number, ignore that array.
Check that items of the given array are arrays.
14. Given an object. Invert it (keys become values and values become keys). If there is more than key forthat
given value create an array.
15. Write a JavaScript function to get all possible subsets of length 3 of the given array. Assume that all
elements in the array are unique.
